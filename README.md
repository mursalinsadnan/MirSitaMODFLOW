***Groundwater Sustainability under Industrial Expansion and Settlement Growth: A Modeling Study of Bangladeshâ€™s Largest Economic Zone***

This repository documents the methodology and progress of my groundwater modeling study, which focuses on the largest industrial economic zone in South Asia, located in coastal Bangladesh. The rapid development of this zone is expected to drive significant industrialization, increased settlement, and rising groundwater demand, creating a high risk of groundwater depletion and long term sustainability challenges.

**Current Progress**
<br/>- The steady state model is Complete (Results under validation). Includes stratigraphic model preparation, computational grid setup, boundary condition definition, dataset integration, and model calibration.
<br/>- Transient Model is currently under development. This phase will expand the study by incorporating time varying recharge, pumping stresses, and dynamic boundary conditions to better evaluate future groundwater stress scenarios.

**Data and Sources**
<br/>- The study integrates multiple datasets, including HydroBASINS, HydroSHEDS, CHIRPS 2.0, Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), and published lithological and geological records.

**Repository Content**
<br/>- Detailed methodology (steady-state completed, transient section under development).
<br/>- Figures, tables, and calibration outputs (to be updated incrementally).

**Note to Reviewers**
<br/>- This repository represents an ongoing research process. The steady state model is complete, but the results are under validation, while the transient phase is under development to simulate the impacts of industrial and settlement-driven groundwater use. The project will be refined and expanded as results progress.
